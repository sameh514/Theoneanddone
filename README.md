# Theoneanddone
//This project was put together to find the effect that the one-and-done rule had on college basketball recruitment. What i found ws that there are common misconseptions that i will be highlighting below.


stament) The One-and-done rule has caused college baketball recruits to syay close to home
Analysis) This was found to  be false based on the data. Pre one-and-done the average distance was 507 and for post it increased to 725

Question) Does the nba draft number have an effect on preformance?
answer) it seems difficult to predict success in a college basketball recruit to the NBA very little correlation
