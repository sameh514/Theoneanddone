The One-and-Done Rule: Examining Its Impact on College Basketball Recruitment

This project investigates the effects of the one-and-done rule on college basketball recruitment. Below, I address some common misconceptions uncovered in the analysis.

Statement: The one-and-done rule has caused college basketball recruits to stay closer to home.
Analysis: This is false according to the data. Before the one-and-done rule, the average distance a recruit traveled to attend college was 507 miles. After the rule was implemented, this distance increased to 725 miles.

Question: Does an NBA draft pick's position predict their performance in the league?
Answer: The data shows little correlation between a recruitâ€™s draft position and their eventual success in the NBA, making it difficult to predict performance based solely on draft ranking.T
